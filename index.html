<h2>110 Programming Concepts</h2>
<p>This project used many concepts learned in Comp110!  We used Object Oriented
  Programming in order to make the individual pieces for our game, such as a "Character"
   class and a "Bomb" class.  These classes have constructors, fields, and methods
   so that they can be used in the main method easily.  We also used basic pieces such
   as if-then statements in order to perform certain tasks.  Most of the project came
   from things learned in class. </p>
