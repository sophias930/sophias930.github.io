<h1>Explosion!</h1>
<p>Sophia Shaikh and Max Wooten</p>
<p>This is a two-player game controlled by the keyboard
  where each player runs around the board and tries to
  avoid being hit by falling bombs.  The first player to
  get hit by a bomb loses!</p>
<h2>110 Programming Concepts</h2>
<p>This project used many concepts learned in Comp110!  We used Object Oriented
  Programming in order to make the individual pieces for our game, such as a "Character"
   class and a "Bomb" class.  These classes have constructors, fields, and methods
   so that they can be used in the main method easily.  We also used basic pieces such
   as if-then statements in order to perform certain tasks.  Most of the project came
   from things learned in class. </p>
<h2>Challenges Overcome and New Concepts</h2>
<p>We tried to use a lot of things we didn't learn, which was difficult.  Our first challenge
  was trying to make a good map for our characters to play on.  The 2D array was a hassle,
  but we figured it out eventually.  We also tried to learn new things, such as connecting the
  movements of the characters to the keyboard.  Another new thing was using timers to set the
  bomb drops.  The bombs also needed a random coordinate generator.  These were all difficult,
  but with a lot of Googling and consulting TA's we figured them out!  The TA's were a HUGE help!
  Another difficulty was setting the boundaries for the characters so that they couldn't move off
  the screen using a bunch of booleans.  Even with all these complications, we eventually got our game
  to work!</p>

  <h2>Individual Contributions to the Project</h2>
  <p>Max and I each put a lot of effort into "Explosion!".  He set up the map, boundaries, and movements
  for the characters, while I created the characters themselves and the bomb and it's timer.  The entire
  effort took the entire night.</p>
  <h2>Goals Achieved</h2>
    <p>We were able to successfully create moving characters and randomly dropping bombs!  Our map and
      boundaries work perfectly.  The game looks beautiful!</p>
  <h2>Goals Outstanding</h2>
  <p>As beautiful as our game is, it isn't quite perfect.  When a character gets hit by a bomb, the
    game doesn't end on it's own.  The players must take initiative and acknowledge that they lost.
    This probably isn't the most sureproof way to determine a winner, so we still need to create a
    way for the game to tell if someone was hit and send out a message declaring the winner.  We will
    get to that at some point in the future</p>
  <p>Aside from that, our game is great!  We hope you enjoy the work we put into it!</p>
